### Crafting Interpreters

### [Javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
- pig game, this keyword, destructuring arrays

### Postgres

### Pytorch DDP
- watched 1st 3 videos of this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ddp_series_intro.html) 
  - second video explained about DDP - data parallel so the distributed sampler divides the data among the multiple gpus. gradient computation(backprop) and communication happen in parallel so GPUs are not starved.
- also tried this [script](https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Distributed-Training/) on two g6.x large instances
