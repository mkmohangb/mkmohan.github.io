### .NET
- Watched this video on [.NET versions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X75vbT-Yv-c)
    - .NET Framework (no longer being developed) - tied to windows
    - .NET core (complete rewrite of the framework which can work on Linux/Mac as well 
    - Current version based on .NET core is 8.x. It is a LTS version.

### Upwork
- Incorporated feedback and completed the work. 
    - for one of the implementations the hash was calculated at character level instead of word level.
    - added benchmark tests using timeit to compare the two implementations namely [floc](https://github.com/hybridtheory/floc-simhash) and [scrapinghub](https://github.com/scrapinghub/python-simhash)
    - Simhash vs Minhash


### Finish by Jon Acuff
- Read the first chapter - day after perfect -  perfectionism is the enemy
