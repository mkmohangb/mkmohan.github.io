### Linear Algebra
- Pavel Grinfeld [LA series on YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRUKXD88IdzS14F4NxAZudSmv)
  - [Lemma](https://www.lem.ma/library)
   - our eye has 100 million sensors in the retina (rod & cone cells) but our ears have only one sensor. Sound enters our ears as a combination(summation) which are then decomposed as a result of which we can hear the individual sound sources.
   - mlk + bach = mlk - bach (mlk - martin luther king). The intuition is that any sound signal can be decomposed as a set of sine waves, so -bach is just a phase shifted sine wave. So addition or subtraction sounds the same.

  - Complex numbers
    - Some polynomials with real coefficients have no real zeros. eg. the equation $x^2 + 1 = 0$ has no real solutions. Thus we invent a solution called i with the property that $i^2 =-1$
    - The symbol i was first used to denote $\sqrt{âˆ’1}$ by Leonhard Euler in 1777
    - were invented so that we can take square root of negative numbers
  
- [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
  - linear algebra is a form of continuous rather than discrete mathematics. A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms.
  - Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, Tensors
  - Multiplying Matrices and Vectors

    - Diagonal
    - Symmetric
    - Orthogonal
    - Unit vector
  - Eigen decomposition
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse
