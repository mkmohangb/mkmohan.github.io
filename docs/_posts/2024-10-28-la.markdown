### Linear Algebra
- Pavel Grinfeld [LA series on YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlXfTHzgMRUKXD88IdzS14F4NxAZudSmv)
  - [Lemma](https://www.lem.ma/library)
   - our eye has 100 million sensors in the retina (rod & cone cells) but our ears have only one sensor. Sound enters our ears as a combination(summation) which are then decomposed as a result of which we can hear the individual sound sources.
   - mlk + bach = mlk - bach (mlk - martin luther king). The intuition is that any sound signal can be decomposed as a set of sine waves, so -bach is just a phase shifted sine wave. So addition or subtraction sounds the same.

  - The symbol i was first used to denote $\sqrt{âˆ’1}$ by Leonhard Euler in 1777
