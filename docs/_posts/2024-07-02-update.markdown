### Resources
- Virtual memory 
    - chapter 9 of Computer Systems: A programmer's perspective which talks about Virtual Memory

- Static program analysis, [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis), [Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis)

- Dynamic program analysis, [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis)
    

- Static Analysis
    - Installed [SonarLint](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarlint/) on IntelliJ and explored Connected mode (link it to SonarQube)
    - SonarQube - definition of new code, [scanners](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/scanners/sonarscanner-for-maven/), [test coverage](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/analyzing-source-code/test-coverage/java-test-coverage/) integration with other tools, can be triggered based on pull request, can target a specific branch, CI integration to suspend pipeline if quality gate fails (can be setup as a github action)
    - Clean Code [definition](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarlint/intellij/concepts/clean-code/definition/)
    - Rules - 4 types - code smell (maintainability), bug (reliability), vulnerability (security), security hotspot (security). [Reference](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/rules/overview/)
    - [Quality profiles](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/instance-administration/quality-profiles/) define the set of rules to be applied during code analysis.
    - [Quality gates](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/quality-gates/) enforce a quality policy in your organization by answering one question: is my project ready for release ?

- Dynamic Analysis
    - [Dynamic data race prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AZIQFeluIY)
        - concurrency bugs inevitably find their way into concurrent software despite rigorous development-time testing. Data races are arguably the most insidious amongst concurrency bugs and are particularly hard to detect.
