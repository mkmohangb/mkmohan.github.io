### Upwork
- digging deeper into [locality sensitive hashing](https://medium.com/engineering-brainly/locality-sensitive-hashing-explained-304eb39291e4)
- Trained small, medium & large GLiNER models using CoNLL2003 on Runpod using 4090 GPU.  small & medium models could be trained in parallel. Did 10 epochs for small & medium, 5 epochs for large. Results [here](https://github.com/mkmohangb/nlp/tree/main/ner)
- Push to the model [repo](https://huggingface.co/usernameandme/gliner-small) failed with the error "Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed size". This happened after one hour - entire model upload had completed :(
