### Upwork
- Went through a few jobs but didn't apply for any. Need to create a github project with model building and deployment on AWS.

 
### CUDA Mode
- Went through a couple of videos related to [cuda basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOxKexn3iBo) and [compute and memory basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTmYrKwjSOU)
