        - AWS Outposts, Wavelength zone, Local zone
        - AZ usually corresponds to a data center, has redundant networking and power sources 
        - CloudFront is a CDN on AWS
        - structure of ipv4 address - network id/host id
        - private address range as per RFC-1918 - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255, 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
        - VPC is a logically isolated portion of the AWS cloud within a region. IGW is attached to the VPC and used to connect to the internet. Route table is used to configure the VPC router. 
        - Each VPC has a different block of IP addresses, CIDR - Classless Interdomain routing
        - You can create upto 5 VPCs per region
        - A default VPC is created in each region with a subnet in each AZ
