### Upwork
- Looked at semantic text similarity 
    - [this](https://github.com/AndriyMulyar/semantic-text-similarity) package
        - provides two models - web & clinical both based on BERT - outputs a score on a scale of 1-5
    - Didn't get around to reading this [one](https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity) on the HF site

    - spent sometime on the Pinecone website related to DPR (Dense Passage Retriever)
        - Dense vs Sparse embeddings
    - [SPLADE](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/splade/)
        - SPLADE - Sparse Lexical and Expansion Model for First Stage Ranking
        - learnable sparse embeddings

    - qdrant vector db, [tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy) - full-text search engine
