### Codecrafters
- completed the [http server exercise](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview) in Python   
    - handle 'Accept-Encoding' with gzip compression

- Started the [build your own interpreter](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) exercise
    - it involves writing an interpreter for the Lox language. Based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystorm

- Found this interesting book on [Staff Engineer](https://staffeng.com/)
    - the missing guide to becoming a staff engineer
