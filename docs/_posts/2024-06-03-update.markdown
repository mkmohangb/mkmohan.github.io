### Event-Driven Arch
This [article](https://gillesbarbier.medium.com/the-way-we-are-building-event-driven-applications-is-misguided-7f7c5f1a9061) talks about taking the orchestration approach instead of choreography which is widely adopted in the industry and leads to technical debt.
    
### Distributed training
This [article](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/accelerating-pytorch-model-training) talks about Mixed-precision training, the use of bfloat16 which extends the dynamic range of float-16 (conceived by Google for TPUs, is available in NVIDIA from Ampere architectures) ```torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()```

and FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallelism) which utilizes both data and tensor parallelism.
