### Crafting Interpreters

### [Javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)

### Postgres
- Used ```pgloader``` to load the f1 db from [here](https://ergast.com/mrd/db/)
- Followed the steps [here](https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/mysql.html?highlight=f1db#in-a-single-command-line)
- Had to use this [workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56542036/pgloader-failed-to-connect-to-mysql-at-localhost-port-3306-as-user-root). Also used mysql@8.0 instead of 9.0
- After import into postgres ran a few queries like top 3 drivers, all the winners in a quarter, anti-join - not finishing a race
- avoid usage of 'select *', explicitly state the columns in select so that it is easier to maintain.

### Pytorch DDP

### Misc
- [Eternal terminal](https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal) 
  - remote shell that automatically reconnects without interrupting the session.
  - uses Eternal TCP - is a layer in between an application and unix TCP sockets that make the sockets robust to TCP disconnects including roaming and connection failure.
