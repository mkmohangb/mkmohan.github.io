### k8s
- Watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha3LjlD6g7g) intro video on k8s **operators**
    - used mainly for stateful applications (e.g. web app with database)
    - operator is used to do the work of a human operator
    - created by experts in that field - e.g. how to create mysql cluster, run it, synchronize the data, to update.
    - examples - prometheus operator, postgres-operator, elastic-operator etc.
- and this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Sl21AKiDg) on how **Prometheus** monitoring works
    - constantly montior all the services, alert when crash, proactively identify problems 
    - e.g. notify if memory usage or disk space crosses a certain threshold
    - pull based system, services have to expose a ```/metrics``` endpoint
    - stores the data in a time-series database which can be queried using PromQL
    - visualization of the metrics can also be done using Grafana dashboardr
    - there is a pushgateway for short-lived jobs
    - AlertManager notifies the user via email, telegram etc.
    - [Architecture overview](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus?tab=readme-ov-file#architecture-overview)
    - [Exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) are useful when the system to be monitored cannot be instrumented directly to expose metrics endpoint e.g. Linux server.
    - easiest way to deploy on k8s is using helm chart.
- [Tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do), good one
