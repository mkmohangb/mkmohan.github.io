### Data-driven
- Gave up after thinking for an hour or so

### Similarity
- Went through this wonderful article on [simhash](https://ferd.ca/simhashing-hopefully-made-simple.html)
    - simhash requires tuning(feature selection - word or shingle, weighting of features, selection of hash) based on the data
- this [report](https://github.com/sumonbis/NearDuplicateDetection/blob/master/Report.pdf) on Near duplicate detection
- this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12967538/5597718) on SO 

### Gen AI
- [Microsoft course](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners)

### Erlang
- Installed erlang. Read a few pages from this [book](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content)

### Patient readmission
- [synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) - synthetic patient data and associated health records
- [aws sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ml-readmission-prediction)
