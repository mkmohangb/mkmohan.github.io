### Upwork
- learnt about [pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument)
    - this set of [videos](https://calmcode.io/course/pyinstrument/introduction) do a good job explaining the main features
    - key thing to note is that it is a statistical profiler - it measures on an interval to record what function is being called and by repeating this many times over a short interval it develops a good idea of where most of the time is spent...but as expected this won't be perfect.
    - [sampler code](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument/blob/main/pyinstrument/stack_sampler.py)
    - control sampling [interval](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument/blob/c4eac163b901a3cee160a74b1152de369c27cb54/pyinstrument/profiler.py#L50) for inline code
    - there is a html render output
    - Flamegraphs using [speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app/) render output is kool
- used pyinstrument to find and fix the bottleneck in MinHash initialization
