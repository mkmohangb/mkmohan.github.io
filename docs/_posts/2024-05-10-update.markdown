### CUDA Mode
- Went through the CUDA torch [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F0YxcurZevIzKAKs9EEDntXTL-efQNSj#scrollTo=fTIjQiiNHYuW)
   - wurlitzer (c-level stdout/stderr in python) and ninja(build system
   - compile cuda c/c++ code using ```torch.utils.cpp_extension.load_inline```
   - cuda arch - Streaming Multiprocessors(SMs), Thread block, shared memory
   - understanding cuda kernels - blocks/threads using examples of rgb2grey and matmul

### Deep Learning book
- Read sections 5.1.1 and 5.11 from the chapter Machine Learning Basics of the book
    - section 5.11 talks about how DL overcomes the shortcomings of ML
        - Manifold Learning
        - meaningful images/words are concentrated in a small portion of the sample space
