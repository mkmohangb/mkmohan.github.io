### Resources
- [Database tuning at ZD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB2lF_Z9cbs)
- [perf. analysis with atop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27AtCR5ftyM)

- [memory leak (.NET)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHGeE_PFA4s)
    - Dump multiple times and take the diff to see the memory leak
    - dotnet dump
    - debug with managed only
    - paths to root
    - ```dotnet-dump analyze <dump file>```
        - use ```sos commands``` to analyze
        - ```eeheap -gc```
        - ```dumpheap -stat```
        - ```dumpheap -mt```
        - ```gcroot <addr>```
    - static object or long lived thread object holding (OOM) - you have a cache of objects
    - native code is holding onto memory (OOM) - gc is not aware of this
    - this becomes apparent with containers where we restrict the memory to the system
