### Resources
- Virtual memory 
    - Half-way through chapter 9 of Computer Systems: A programmer's perspective which talks about Virtual Memory
        - VM as a tool for caching
            - Virtual pages, Physical pages
            - page table maps virtual pages to physical pages
            - page table is an array of page table entries (PTEs)
            - page fault, page fault exception
            - swapped in disk to DRAM, swapped out DRAM to disk
            - demand paging - waiting until the last moment to swap in a page
            - working set / resident set
        - VM as a tool for memory management
            - multiple virtual pages can be mapped to the same physical page
            - simplifies loading, sharing, memory allocation
        - VM as a tool for memory protection.
            - separate virtual address spaces makes it easy to isolate the private memories of different processes
            - adding permission bits in PTE to control access
        - Address translation
            - speeding up address translation with TLB
            - multi-level page tables

### Java Webapp
- Tried the example Java Servlet web app from [here](https://www.marcobehler.com/courses/spring-professional)
