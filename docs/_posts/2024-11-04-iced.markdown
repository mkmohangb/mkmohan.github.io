### iced
- iced is a gui library for Rust based on the [elm architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/)
  - the basic concepts are
    1. State - state of your application
    2. Messages - user interactions or meaningful events you care about
    3. View logic - way to display state as widgets that may produce messages on user interaction
    4. Update logic - way to react to messages and update your state
  - tried this simple counter example from [here](https://jl710.github.io/iced-guide/quickstart/3_a_simple_counter_app.html)
  - Using cursor helped in a few ways - 
     - auto complete 
     - help with things for which I didn't know the syntax like using ```format!``` macro for string interpolation 
     - fixing an issue with variable getting moved when using ```Element.explain``` for debugging. This took a few back and forth in the chat because the solution it suggested didn't work as the APIs had changed in the recent versions, logical errors etc.
