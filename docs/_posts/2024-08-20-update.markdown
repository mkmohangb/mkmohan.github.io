### Message Queues
  - [what is a message queue by Clemens Vasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHSV916YbHE)
    - message queues are everywhere - OS scheduling queues, threadpool worker queue, TCP Network queue, http request queue - shown in the context of a remote RPC call
    - queues - fifo, priority, multiplex queue
  - [intro](https://hookdeck.com/blog/introduction-message-queue)
    - producer, message q, consumer
    - implementation - frameworks - RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, Apache Kafka?, full managed services - Amazon SQS/MQ, Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  - [deepdive](https://hookdeck.com/blog/message-queues-deep-dive)
    - message broker - handling ingestion, persistence and delivery of messages
      - message oriented middleware or enterprise service bus
      [simple guide to MQ](https://dev.to/tamerlang/the-simple-guide-to-message-queues-82a)
      - AMQP is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.
      - features include message orientation, queuing, Routing(including point-to-point & pub/sub), Reliability & Security

### Event gateway
  - [Hookdeck](https://hookdeck.com/platform)
    - for receiving, processing and delivering asynchronous messages
    - [usecases](https://hookdeck.com/docs/hookdeck-basics#use-cases)
      - inbound/outbound webhook infra, 3rd party to 3rd party message routing, async api gateway infra, serverless message broker

### Web hooks
  - [what is a webhook](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-a-webhook)
    - web - http based, hook - allows apps to intercept calls or other events that might be of interest
    - webhook - hook the event that occurs on the server app, and prompt the server to send the payload to theclient via the web
    - [original blog post by Jeff Lindsay which introduced webhook](https://progrium.github.io/blog/2007/05/03/web-hooks-to-revolutionize-the-web/)
      - "Web hooks are essentially user defined callbacks made with HTTP POST. To support web hooks, you allow the user to specify a URL where your application will post to and on what events. Now your application is pushing data out wherever your users want. Itâ€™s pretty much like re-routing STDOUT on the command line."
