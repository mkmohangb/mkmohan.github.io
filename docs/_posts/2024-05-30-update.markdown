### Upwork
- briefly looked at the problem of generating similar hash values for similar strings
    - [simhash](https://github.com/1e0ng/simhash)

### semantic search demo
- tried the demo from [here](https://github.com/ashvardanian/usearch-images)
    - had to revert the use of stringzilla.File
    - use unum-cloud/uform3-image-text-multilingual-base instead of unum-cloud/uform-vl-multilingual-v2(onnx files were missing also there were no separate text/image model files)
    - download urls mentioned in the README were incorrect
    - when downloading from hf private repo need to add the bearer token to wget: ```--header="Authorization: Bearer <HF_TOKEN>"```

### openai
- spent sometime studying about assistants, function calling, file search.
- also tried the following topics with [Ranedeer AI Tutor](https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor) as GPTs are now available with free account
    - Intermediate/advanced python
    - LLM deployment
