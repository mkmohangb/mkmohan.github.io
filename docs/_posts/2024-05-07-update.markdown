### Upwork

- Didn't apply for any jobs. But found a couple of pointers to delve further. One on [ORPO alignment algo](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/orpo-llama-3) and the other on 2D to 3D conversion of 2D key points/ translate hand signs to text and generating hand & facial keypoints from textual descriptions. 
    

### Spacy
- Completed the 2nd and 4th chapters of [Advanced NLP with Spacy](https://course.spacy.io/en/chapter1)
