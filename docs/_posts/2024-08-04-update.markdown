### Resources
- Async adventures
  - C# vs Python - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56245509/start-async-task-now-await-later)
        - seems like in C# the async task starts off immediately while in python there is hack needed to achieve the same

  - [asyncio in python3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM)
  - [David Beazley concurrency from ground up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=MCs5OvhV9S4)
    - Talks about the impact of GIL using socket server - client
        - socket server returns the nth fibonacci number
        - making the server side multithreaded doesn't help with the turn around time for client as the work is cpu intensive
        - also GIL prioritizes cpu intensive task, if there is one client repeatedly asking for the 1st fibonacci number(throughput is x requests/sec), and there is a second client requesting for the 50th fibonacci number, then the first client sees a drastic dip in the requests/sec => x to x/1000
