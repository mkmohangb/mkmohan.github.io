- Dynamic Analysis
    - this [perf workshop](https://github.com/cchesser/java-perf-workshop/) is good
        - had to install java8 to get it working (```brew install --cask zulu@8```, jdk installed at ```/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-8.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java```)
        - Tried the following tools:

- Static Analysis
    - Installed [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/setup-and-upgrade/install-the-server/introduction/) locally and ran it on the java-perf-workshop repo
    - Used Postgres as db - created sonarqube user, sonarqube database and my_schema within db.
