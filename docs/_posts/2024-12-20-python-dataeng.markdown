### LLM Agents
  - skimmed through this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14161) about evaluating LLM agents
  - went through the documentation of [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)
    - system arch is [here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/docs/static/img/system_architecture_overview.png)
    - React router based frontend, backend is more involved using FastAPI
  - Also this project which converts [screenshot to code](https://github.com/abi/screenshot-to-code)
    - React/Vite frontend + FastAPI backend
### Python
  - learnt some basics about Poetry - dependency & packaging tool for Python
    - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
    - this [video](https://youtu.be/Xf8K3v8_JwQ?si=oSBXUDhvd54RO41U) and this [one](https://youtu.be/Ji2XDxmXSOM?si=mabAcqwSdOppnJHB)

### React router
  - Tried a basic example of using it as a framework(OpenHands seems to use it this way) from [here](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/installation)

### Data Engg.
  - Did the [cumulative dimensions day 1 lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWj8VeBEQCc&t=4s) again
