### Upwork

- Applied for one job
    

### Numpy
- Solved problems 21 - 35
- for in-place op. use out parameter, np.datetime64('today'), np.arange accepts datetime64[D] dtype, np.dtype, np.logical_and (or use multiple conditions each enclosed by parentheses), np.intersect1d, ignore warnings using np.seterr(all="ignore")
  

### Ollama
- Read through and tried the progress bar related changes in [Ollama repo](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/progress). 

### Answer.ai
- Directly trying the solution requires 128 GB RAM which is available in runpod.io with only one or two types of instances. Also need to get a grasp of LoRA, FSDP using smaller examples. Went through the image classification example in HF PEFT repo - there are 2 variants using model from timm & HF hub.
