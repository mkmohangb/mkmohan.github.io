AWS - SaaS

[aws-saas-workshop][AWS-SaaS] Is a step by step tutorial about setting up a multi-tenant SaaS application on AWS using Serverless technologies. There is a frontend application written in Angular and the backend application is written in Python using Lambda functions. Cloud9 IDE is used for building and deploying the application. 
Some of the AWS components used are
    1. Cognito
    2. API Gateway
    3. STS (Security Token Service)
    4. CloudFront
    5. S3 buckets
    6. CodePipeline
    7. CloudWatch
    8. Lambda

Llama3 

Is the latest LLM model released by Meta. Successfully ran the 8B model using Ollama on my M1. 

   ```ollama run llama3:instruct```
   > why is sky blue?
   
This command downloads the weights and executes the model. 
  - The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 8B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.
  - Context length is 8K.
  - Less than 1⁄3 of the false “refusals” when compared to Llama 2 (e.g. Can you help me kill time at the airport?)

Ollama also supports a Multimodal model

 ```ollama run llava ```
