### LLM Instruction Finetuning
- Tried this [notebook](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/blob/main/ch07/01_main-chapter-code/ch07.ipynb) from the LLM-from-scratch [repo](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch)
- pretrained LLMs are good at generating the next word but is not good at following instructions
- This [video](https://youtu.be/bZQun8Y4L2A?si=g6KGXz5oKLJLL6RX&t=698) by Karpathy explains it well. It is still Language Modeling but using a different dataset.
